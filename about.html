	<div> <p class="indent">My name is Courtney Spisak. I was born and raised in the San Fransisco Bay Area. My fondness for the arts began at the young age of five. It was at this time that I attended an after school art camp learning to draw and paint Pokemon characters.  My five year old self thought this was truly magical. From there I spent several summers in different art camps. Another form of art that is part of who I am is music. I began with formal piano lessons at the age of nine, and as the years progressed I continued to pick up other instruments. These include flute, mallet percussion, and most recently guitar. My passion for the visual arts really grew when I started bead weaving which was inspired by my Native American roots. This led to my interest in pixel art and then expanded more into the digital realm.

	<p class="indent">My aspiration is to pursue a career in the video game industry as a 3D modeling artist.  I greatly enjoy making three dimensional creations appear from an empty workspace and evolve. I want to use games as an artistic medium that utilizes interactivity in a meaningful way. I am motivated to help design and develop games around different concepts including psychology, philosophy, and horror. My favorite style of games are those with a deep story that encourage the player to delve into their emotions and think critically.

	<p class="indent">Aside from art I also enjoy traveling, spending time with family and friends, running, swimming, debating ethical issues and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
