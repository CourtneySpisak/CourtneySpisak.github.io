	<div> <p class="indent">On Its Back We March Forward is a bronze sculpture of a snapping turtle. In this piece, I aimed to create a sculptural representation of the symbol and resilience of the Wyandotte Nation. I chose to model the snapping turtle walking because I wanted to represent the passage of time in the world and the progress of the Wyandotte Nation. Despite the adversities faced in the past, the Nation still stands strong and moves forward.  The twelve different clans are etched on the shell of the turtle, as well as the council fire, which sits in the most center part of the shell, keeping watch and providing guidance over each of the clans. 
During the process of making this sculpture, it was transferred between several different media. I wanted to explore the process of making a digital art piece into a tangible object.  This piece originally started as a digital 3D model made in Blender. Beginning as a cube, I added geometry and modeled it into the turtle utilizing low-poly modeling and high-poly sculpting. When I had a 3D model that I was happy with, it was 3D printed using PLA filament in two parts: the front half and the back half. This model was then gated in wax, and a plaster mold was made from it. Then bronze was poured into the mold. The final finishing process included welding the two parts of the turtle together, cleaning up the weld, reetching any lost details, cleaning up the gates, and sandblasting. The final reddish brown color is made from a patina consisting of Blackner and Ferric Nitrate. After the patina was applied, the sculpture was waxed and buffed. 
This piece was a part of the Wyandotte Nation 2025 Artisan Showcase under the category of Diverse Artform.
